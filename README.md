# Principal-Component-Analysis
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) performed on the UsArrests dataset retrieved from Kaggle to apply various clustering techniques to identify trends and correlations.

The project begins with the exploration of the dataset to identify any anomalies that may have an effect on the clustering and correlation results. The project is initialised to identify correlations that may be present between various factors such as the number of arrests by city, or reason of arrest based on the urban population size. In summary, to identify which factors may play a role in the crime rate (at the time) and how those factors contribute to the crime rate in the various cities.
